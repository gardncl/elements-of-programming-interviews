    Write a program which takes as input an array of disjoint
    closed intervals with integer endpoints, sorted by
    increasing order of left endpoint, and an interval
    to be added, and returns the union of the intervals in the
    array and the added interval. Your result should be
    expressed as a union of disjoint intervals sorted by left
    endpoint.
